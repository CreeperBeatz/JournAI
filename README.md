## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI GPT-3 API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CreeperBeatz/JournAI.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd JournAI
    ```

3. **Activate a Python Virtual Environment**

    I recommend doing that in a Python Virtual Environment. You can create and
    activate one by typing:
    ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   Activate the Venv
    ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
   
4. **Install requirements**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Setup the config file**

    Rename `config_sample.cfg` to `config.cfg` and update it with your GPT-3 API key.

    ```bash
    [OpenAI]
    API_Key = your_gpt3_api_key_here

6. **Run the app**

    Use Streamlit to run the app.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.
    The app automatically creates an SQLite Database.
